## Configuration

### Basic Setup

The add-on works with default settings out of the box:

- Listens on port `5353` (both TCP and UDP)
- Allows access from all networks
- Uses Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) as upstream

### Custom Configuration

For advanced users, you can provide your own `unbound.conf` file:

1. Place your custom `unbound.conf` file in the add-on's configuration directory
2. The add-on will automatically detect and use it on restart

The configuration directory path is: `/config/unbound/unbound.conf`

### Example Custom Configuration

```
server:
    interface: 0.0.0.0
    port: 5353
    access-control: 192.168.1.0/24 allow
    cache-min-ttl: 300
    cache-max-ttl: 86400
    do-ip6: no

forward-zone:
    name: "."
    forward-addr: 1.1.1.1
    forward-addr: 8.8.8.8
```

## Usage
